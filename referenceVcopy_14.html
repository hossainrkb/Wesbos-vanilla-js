    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let a=10;
    b=a;
    console.log(a,b);
    b=500;
    console.log(typeof(b));
    console.log(a,b)
    console.clear()
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    //array untouched if you using slice, array from and spread (ES6) operator.
    teams = [...players];
    team1 = players.slice(1,3);


    console.log(team1);
    teams.push("javascript");
   // console.log(teams);
    //make it sure that teams just hold the reference of player. so if anything change in team it also make an effect in players array.
    console.log(players)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    //console.log(players.slice(1,3));
   

    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    // and think we make a copy:
    const js = person; // this is called carry object reference take.
    const javaScript = Object.assign({},person,{author:"wesbos"}); // this is called object mutation.
    js.name="add js";
    console.clear();
    console.log(person);
    console.log(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(javaScript)));
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
